## Architecture
The app is using MVVM
- Model: Represents the data and the core business logic of the application. It is responsible for handling data-related tasks such as fetching, storing, and managing data
- View: Component that deals with the user interface. It displays information to the user and responds to user interactions
- ViewModel: Serves as a mediator between the View and the Model. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it if necessary (e.g., formatting or filtering), and provides it to the View in a format that is ready for display. It also handles user input by passing commands from the View back to the Model
